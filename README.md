rate 3/10 

learning 
1.) for loop     for(int i = 0; i <= 10; i++)  it will save the value of i once then will check i if its less than 10 then will print the inside of the loop
after executing the inside it will go back to the top to do i++ then will check again if i <= 10 but the value of i now is 1. because the firts value is 0;

2.) while loop / do while   you will inititalize a value firts. To create an condition for the loop. Here works checking the value just once. then proceed to the inside you should put i++ inside it will
decide the outcome and when to stop.
